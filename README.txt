#Welcome To My Bubble Shooter Game

    ##Features added:
        -> All the required features has been added.
        -> Two of three extra features has been added.
        -> List of extra features goes as follows:
            -> Bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubbles, it splits into 
            smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally 
            opposite directions.
            -> A score, time and a health counter added. The score increases whenever you hit a bubble. 
            The game gets over when we run out of time (measured in seconds) or if we run out of 
            health (whenever the bubble hits the shooter, the health reduces by 1).

    ##Rules of the game:

        1) You will be the shooter at the bottom of the game window. 
        2) You can press W to shoot bullets, A, D to move left and right direction respectively. 
        Press q to close the game.
        3) Bubbles will be spawned from the top of game window, in the parabolic trajectory.
        4) Just like an usual game, you will lose a life if bubble hits you(shooter). You can notice
        by the colour change in shooter(to black colour).
        5) If u click a large bubble, it will break into small bubbles. At a size, bubble will vanish 
        when shot.
        6) You can score points by shooting bubbles. 
        7) You will be provided 3 lives. If you lose them all, you lose the game(You lose a life if you 
        getting hit by bubble).
